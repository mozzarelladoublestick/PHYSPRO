# Shadowseeker

## Abstract

After a detailed ideation process, considering different ideas for our Chindōgu, we have decided on implementing a moving device that carries a bottle of beer or another desired drink. The goal of the device is to keep the drink cold by driving into the shadow, hence the name "Shadowseeker". THe only small flaw that the Shadowseeker has, is that it can only drive in the sun.

## Introduction

A first phase of finding our solution for the Shadowseeker has led us to this first rough sketch:

The shadowseeker should have 4 wheels and 2 axes that are robust enough to hold the weight of a drink as well as the device itself. Moreover, it should have a place to put the beer without being in danger of falling off.

At this point it was clear that we would have to use a strong material for the wheels, the axes and the cup holder.

For the prototype we had a motor combined with a solar panel from a LEGO set in use which was supposed to be the Shadowseeker's power source, making sure it can only drive in the sun.

Considering the poor feedback that the device gave to the user in the first state, we have decided to have little lights as well as a short beep that indicate that the motor has started as soon as the Shadowseeker hit the sun.

## Implementation 

The parts we needed to construct were the following:

-the body of the device
-the wheels
-the motor
-the feedback components (lights and sound)

### Wheels

Getting the right wheels was quiet the challenge. The inner whole of the wheel needed to have the same radius as the connecting part of the motor, which made it very challenging to find something fitting. After not being able to find the right wheel in old lego sets or even online, we have decided to 3D print the wheels ourselves.

Using a wheel that we found in the lab (but unfortunately only had one) as a reference, we built a 3D model in Autodesk Fusion.
{{< figure src="wheel_01.png" caption="*Inner wheel*">}}
{{< figure src="wheel_02.png" caption="*Outer wheel*">}}

We sketched different models for only the inner part of the wheel as well, to make sure that the motor fits and prevent to print a wheel that will not even fit.

Due to the tiny inaccuracy of the 3D printer or the meassurements, the inner part did not fit perfectly on the motor but some glue fixed that problem.

### Iteration №1 Wheels

### Iteration №2

This did also not work.

### Iteration №3

This worked!
